GeekSpeak is a technology radio show which consits of a group of Geeks covering news of the week, doing interviews, and taking listener questions.

The GeekSpeak.org site - allows the creation of episodes, episodes have participants and bits.
A bit is a title (required), a link, and content.
Bits are ordered to represent when they were covered on the radio show.
Episodes can also have images and, of course, audio files.

## Changes
To suggest changes or report bugs please create an issue on github.

## Note
This codebase is not really generic enough to run other Podcasts without a bit of work. If you are intersted in doing so please contact me so I can help with the "generification" of the system. - it is on my long term todo list.
